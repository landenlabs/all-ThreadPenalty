Measure Thread Locality Penalty which is the extra time wasted when multiple threads access memory close together. 
Concurrent memory modification can cause CPU memory caches to get invalidated inflicting extra time on the 2nd thread 
accessing the cached memorhy location.


Using C++ Threads, access memory from multiple threads and measure access time. 
Plot graph of access time based on distance between memory locations accessed by concurrent threads.
